    <p>In my role, I work across both backend and client-side systems, contributing to production codebases using <em>Java, XML, and TypeScript</em>. My work involves implementing and debugging event-driven logic, investigating client–server integration issues, and resolving complex state-driven behaviour in large systems. Working in a production environment has strengthened my ability to analyse problems, navigate large codebases, and deliver reliable solutions.</p>
    
    <p>I am currently seeking graduate software engineering opportunities where I can grow within larger engineering teams, structured mentorship, and contribute to building impactful, large-scale systems.</p>
