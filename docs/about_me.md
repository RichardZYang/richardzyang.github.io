I study computer science.

I used to play [competitive soccer](https://websites.mygameday.app/team_info.cgi?action=PSTATS&pID=197536283&client=1-10179-150739-399133-20390196&ocompID=399133) until I got injured in 2021 =(

I like going on outdoor adventures.

These are some of my favourite initiatives I got to be a part of:
